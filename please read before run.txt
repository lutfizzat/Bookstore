before you can run the code, you need to pip install a few things.

open the src file on the command prompt and do the following:

1.pip install Pillow
2.pip install django-crispy-forums
3.pip install requirements -r requirements.txt

and then in the same command prompt after installation is done, type:

python manage.py runserver

after the server has run, copy the https/ and paste it on the browser
